This is my personal portfolio website ! :bowtie:

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   bundle install
   ```
2. Build the site and run checks:
   ```
   bash build.sh
   ```
   This verifies the blog index has a hero section and post list and runs `html-proofer` to check links and structure.
