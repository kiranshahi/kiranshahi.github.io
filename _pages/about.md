<h2>Background</h2>
<p>👋 Hello, I'm Kiran Shahi, a software engineer from Pokhara, Nepal.</p>
<p>💻 My journey in the world of technology began after completing my Bachelor's degree in Computing from Islington College in Kathmandu. In July 2017, I joined Braindigit as a software engineer, where I honed my skills and gained practical experience. It was during this time that my passion for software engineering and artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, neural networks, and computer vision, flourished.</p>
<p>🎓 In March 2021, I decided to take my knowledge to the next level and pursued a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence in London, United Kingdom. This educational endeavor allowed me to dive deeper into the field, expanding my expertise and fueling my enthusiasm for technology.</p>
