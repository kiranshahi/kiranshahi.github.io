👋 Hello, I'm Kiran Shahi, a software engineer from Pokhara, Nepal.

💻 My journey in the world of technology began after completing my Bachelor's degree in Computing from Islington College in Kathmandu. In July 2017, I joined Braindigit as a software engineer, where I honed my skills and gained practical experience. It was during this time that my passion for software engineering and artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, neural networks, and computer vision, flourished.

🎓 In March 2021, I decided to take my knowledge to the next level and pursued a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence in London, United Kingdom. This educational endeavor allowed me to dive deeper into the field, expanding my expertise and fueling my enthusiasm for technology.

💼 In January 2023, I embarked on a new chapter in my career as a software engineer at MBS Survey Software Ltd. Here, I have the opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges, contributing to the development of innovative solutions.

⏳ During my leisure time, I make it a priority to stay up to date with the latest tech advancements by exploring the internet and reading tech blogs. Additionally, I maintain an active and balanced lifestyle. As a 1-degree Seido Karate black belt and a fitness enthusiast, I embrace the physical aspect of personal growth alongside my love for technology.

🌟 I am passionate about leveraging my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact in the software engineering field. I am open to new opportunities and collaborations, so feel free to connect with me!
